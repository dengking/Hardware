A **memory model** tells you, for a given processor or toolchain, exactly what types of memory reordering to expect at runtime relative to a given source code listing. Keep in mind that the effects of memory reordering can only be observed when [lock-free programming](http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming) techniques are used.

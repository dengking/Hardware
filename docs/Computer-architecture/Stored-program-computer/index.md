# Stored-program computer

stored-program computer是非常重要的思想。



## wikipedia [Stored-program computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer)

A **stored-program computer** is one which stores [program instructions](https://infogalactic.com/info/Instruction_(computer_science)) in electronic memory.[[1\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Stored-program_computer#cite_note-1) Often the definition is extended with the requirement that the treatment of programs and data in memory be interchangeable or uniform.[[2\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Stored-program_computer#cite_note-GilreathLaplante2003-2)[[3\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Stored-program_computer#cite_note-Reilly2003-3)[[4\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Stored-program_computer#cite_note-POCA-4)

A computer with a [Von Neumann architecture](https://infogalactic.com/info/Von_Neumann_architecture) stores program data and instruction data in the same memory; a computer with a [Harvard architecture](https://infogalactic.com/info/Harvard_architecture) has separate memories for storing program and data.[[5\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Stored-program_computer#cite_note-Page2009-5)[[6\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Stored-program_computer#cite_note-Balch2003-6)

> NOTE: von neumann architecture 和 Harvard architecture的差异



The stored-program computer idea can be traced back to the 1936 theoretical concept of a [universal Turing machine](https://infogalactic.com/info/Universal_Turing_machine).[[11\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Stored-program_computer#cite_note-Copeland2006-11) Von Neumann was aware of this paper, and he impressed it on his collaborators as well.[[12\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/Stored-program_computer#cite_note-Teuscher2004-12)

> NOTE: 关于谁首先提出这个概念，历史学家追溯到了Turing

## Function and data model

[Stored-program computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer)思想告诉我们: 在memory中，有如下两类:

1、instruction

2、data

在`./Function-and-data-model`中，将基于此来构建起一个连接software和hardware的uniform model。

## TODO

一、quora [**What is the cache block size, it is bigger than one cache line? For example, in the event of L1 cache miss, does it load one 64B or more cache line?**](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-cache-block-size-it-is-bigger-than-one-cache-line-For-example-in-the-event-of-L1-cache-miss-does-it-load-one-64B-or-more-cache-line)

二、在阅读 stackoverflow [Purpose of memory alignment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/381244/purpose-of-memory-alignment) # [A](https://stackoverflow.com/a/381368) 时，其中的"Bonus: Caches"段中提及了cache line，其中提及了这些内容:

> Another alignment-for-performance that I alluded to previously is alignment on cache lines which are (for example, on some CPUs) 64B.

> For more info on how much performance can be gained by leveraging caches, take a look at [Gallery of Processor Cache Effects](http://igoro.com/archive/gallery-of-processor-cache-effects/); from this [question on cache-line sizes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14707803/line-size-of-l1-and-l2-caches)

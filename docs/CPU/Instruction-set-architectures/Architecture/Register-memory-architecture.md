# Register memory architecture

## wikipedia [Register memory architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_memory_architecture)

In [computer engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering), a **register–memory architecture** is an [instruction set architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) that allows operations to be performed on (or from) memory, as well as [registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_memory_architecture#cite_note-Flynn9-1) If the architecture allows all operands to be in memory or in registers, or in combinations, it is called a "register plus memory" architecture.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_memory_architecture#cite_note-Flynn9-1)

In a register–memory approach one of the operands for ADD operation may be in memory, while the other is in a register. This differs from a [load/store architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load/store_architecture)(used by [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing) designs such as [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture)) in which both operands for an ADD operation must be in registers before the ADD.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_memory_architecture#cite_note-Flynn9-1)

Examples of register memory architecture are [IBM System/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360), its successors, and [Intel x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_x86).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_memory_architecture#cite_note-Flynn9-1) Examples of register plus memory architecture are [VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX) and the [Motorola 68000 family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000_family).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_memory_architecture#cite_note-Flynn9-1)
